# Two-Dashboard Event Management System

## 🎯 **System Overview**

This implements a clean two-dashboard system:
- **Admin Dashboard**: For system administrators to manage users and assign organizer roles
- **User Dashboard**: Unified interface for all users (regular users and organizers) with role-based features

## 🏗️ **Dashboard Architecture**

### **Admin Dashboard**
- **User Management**: View all users, assign/remove admin and organizer roles
- **Confirmation Popups**: Admin gets confirmation dialog when assigning organizer roles
- **Real-time Updates**: Role changes reflect instantly across the system

### **User Dashboard**
- **Unified Interface**: Same 4 tabs for all users (Home, Events, Tickets, Profile)
- **Role-Based Features**: Organizers get additional functionality within the same interface
- **Dynamic UI**: Interface adapts based on user's current role

## 📱 **User Dashboard Structure**

### **Tab 1: Home** (`UnifiedHomeScreen`)
- **All Users**: View all published events
- **Event Discovery**: Search, filter by category
- **Smart Navigation**:
  - Regular users → Event details → Buy tickets
  - Organizers → Own events show "MY EVENT" badge → Manage event

### **Tab 2: Events** (`UserEventsTabScreen`)
- **All Users**: "Create New Event Request" button
- **Organizers**: Additional "My Assigned Events" section
- **Dynamic Content**: Interface adapts based on `isOrganizer` field

### **Tab 3: Tickets** (`UserTicketsOverviewScreen`)
- **All Users**: View purchased tickets with QR codes
- **Ticket Management**: Download PDFs, view details

### **Tab 4: Profile** (`UserProfileScreen`)
- **Role Display**: Shows "User" or "Organizer" based on `isOrganizer` field
- **Real-time Updates**: Role changes instantly when admin assigns organizer status
- **Account Info**: Name, email, role, member since date

## 🔧 **Admin Dashboard Workflow**

### **User Management** (`UserListScreen`)
- **View All Users**: Complete list with roles (User/Organizer/Admin)
- **Role Assignment**:
  - **Make Admin/Remove Admin**: Standard admin role management
  - **Make Organizer/Remove Organizer**: Assign organizer status with confirmation popup
- **Confirmation Popups**:
  ```
  "Are you sure you want to assign [UserName] as an Organizer?"
  [Cancel] [Confirm]
  ```
- **Instant Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in user's profile

### **Role Management Logic**
```dart
// Promote to Organizer
await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
  'isOrganizer': true,
});

// Remove Organizer
await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).update({
  'isOrganizer': false,
});
```

## 🚀 **Complete User Flows**

### **Regular User Experience**
1. **Login/Signup** → Lands on User Dashboard
2. **Home Tab**: Browse all published events → Click event → View details → Buy tickets
3. **Events Tab**: Only sees "Create New Event Request" button
4. **Tickets Tab**: View purchased tickets with QR codes
5. **Profile Tab**: Shows role as "User"

### **Organizer Experience** (After Admin Assignment)
1. **Admin assigns organizer role** → Confirmation popup → User upgraded
2. **Profile Tab**: Role automatically changes from "User" → "Organizer"
3. **Home Tab**: Same as regular user + own events show "MY EVENT" badge
4. **Events Tab**:
   - "Create New Event Request" button (same as regular user)
   - **Additional**: "My Assigned Events" section with management access
5. **Tickets Tab**: Same as regular user (tickets purchased as customer)

### **Admin Experience**
1. **Admin Dashboard** → User Management
2. **View all users** with current roles (User/Organizer/Admin)
3. **Assign Organizer**: Click "Make Org" → Confirmation popup → User upgraded instantly
4. **Remove Organizer**: Click "Remove Org" → Confirmation popup → User downgraded

## 🔧 **Files Created/Updated**

### **New User Dashboard Files**
1. `lib/screens/unified_dashboard.dart` - Main dashboard with 4 tabs
2. `lib/screens/user_events_tab_screen.dart` - Events tab with role-based content
3. `lib/dashboards/User_dashboard/user_screens/user_profile_screen.dart` - Enhanced profile with role display

### **Updated Admin Files**
1. `lib/dashboards/admin_dashbaord/user_list_screen.dart` - Added organizer assignment with confirmation popups

### **Existing Files Reused**
1. `lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart` - Home tab (all published events)
2. `lib/screens/user_tickets_overview_screen.dart` - Tickets tab
3. `lib/screens/organizer_event_details_screen.dart` - Event management for organizers
4. `lib/EntryPointFilesScreens/contact_form.dart` - Event request form

## 📊 **Firestore Structure**

### **`users` Collection** (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "role": "string", // "admin", "user" (for admin management)
  "isOrganizer": "boolean", // true when assigned by admin
  "isSystemAdmin": "boolean", // true for system administrators
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### **Role Logic**
- **`isSystemAdmin: true`**: System administrator (cannot be modified)
- **`role: "admin"`**: Regular admin (can be promoted/demoted)
- **`isOrganizer: true`**: Organizer (assigned by admin with confirmation)
- **Default**: Regular user

### **Existing Collections** (Unchanged)
- `events` - Event data with `assignedOrganizerUid` field
- `tickets` - User ticket purchases
- `ticketTypes` - Event ticket configurations
