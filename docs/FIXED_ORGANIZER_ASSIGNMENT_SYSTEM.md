# âœ… FIXED Organizer Assignment System

## ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL FIXES MADE**

### **âœ… Fixed Event Request Approval Process**
- **Problem**: Code was trying to update `events` collection instead of `event_requests`
- **Solution**: Updated `event_request_utils.dart` to work with correct collections
- **Result**: Approval process now works with Firestore properly

### **âœ… Fixed Organizer Assignment Flow**
- **Problem**: System wasn't properly assigning organizers to users
- **Solution**: Added proper user role update in Firestore
- **Result**: Users get `isOrganizer: true` when assigned by admin

### **âœ… Fixed Event Display for Organizers**
- **Problem**: Assigned events weren't showing in "My Assigned Events"
- **Solution**: Updated query to use `organizerUid` field
- **Result**: Organizers can see their assigned events

## ðŸ“Š **WORKING Firestore Structure**

### **`event_requests` Collection** (Pending Requests)
```json
{
  "eventTitle": "string",
  "eventDescription": "string", 
  "eventDate": "timestamp",
  "location": "string",
  "organizerName": "string",
  "organizerEmail": "string",
  "organizerUid": "string",
  "status": "pending|approved|rejected",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "eventId": "string", // Added after approval
  "approvedAt": "timestamp" // Added after approval
}
```

### **`events` Collection** (Approved Events)

  "eventDescription": "string",
  "eventDate": "timestamp", 
  "location": "string",
  "organizerUid": "string",
  "organizerEmail": "string",
  "organizerName": "string",
  "assignedOrganizerUid": "string",
  "assignedOrganizerEmail": "string",
  "status": "approved|published|draft",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "approvedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### **`users` Collection** (User Roles)

}
```

## ðŸš€ **WORKING Admin Approval Flow**

1. Admin sees request in Admin Dashboard
2. Admin clicks "Approve & Assign Organizer"
3. Confirmation popup appears

### **Step 3: Admin Approves (FIXED)**
1. **Get request data** from `event_requests` collection
2. **Update user role**: Set `isOrganizer: true` in `users` collection
3. **Create approved event**: Add to `events` collection with organizer details
4. **Update request status**: Mark as approved in `event_requests` collection

### **Step 4: User Gets Organizer Access**
1. User's profile automatically shows "Organizer" role
