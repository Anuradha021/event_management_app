# Ticket System Fixes & Testing Guide

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. User Dashboard Integration** ✅
- **Problem**: User dashboard wasn't showing ticket functionality
- **Fix**: Replaced `BookTickitScreen` placeholder with full event list + ticket integration
- **Location**: `lib/dashboards/User_dashboard/user_screens/book_tickit_screen.dart`

### **2. Firestore Query Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: `orderBy` queries requiring composite indexes
- **Fix**: Removed `orderBy` from Firestore queries, added in-memory sorting
- **Location**: `lib/services/ticket_service.dart`

### **3. Debug Functionality** ✅
- **Added**: Debug screen to test ticket creation
- **Added**: Debug logging to track issues
- **Location**: `lib/screens/debug_ticket_screen.dart`

## 🚀 **How to Test the Fixed System**

### **Step 1: Access User Dashboard**
1. Open your app
2. Navigate to User Dashboard
3. Click "Tickets" tab in bottom navigation
4. You should see "Events & Tickets" screen

### **Step 2: Test Debug Screen**
1. In the "Events & Tickets" screen
2. Click the **bug icon** (🐛) in the top-right
3. This opens the Debug Ticket Screen

### **Step 3: Create Ticket Types (Debug Method)**
1. In Debug Screen:
   - Select an event from dropdown
   - Fill in ticket name (e.g., "General Admission")
   - Fill in price (e.g., "25.00")
   - Fill in quantity (e.g., "100")
   - Click "Create Ticket Type"
2. Check console for debug messages
3. Ticket should appear in the list below

### **Step 4: Test User Flow**
1. Go back to main "Events & Tickets" screen
2. Click "View Tickets" on any event
3. You should see:
   - "Buy Tickets" tab with available tickets
   - "My Tickets" tab (empty initially)

### **Step 5: Test Organizer Flow**
1. Go to Organizer Dashboard
2. Select an event
3. Click "Tickets" tab (5th tab)
4. You should see the ticket types you created

## 🐛 **Debug Information**

### **Console Messages to Look For:**
```
DEBUG: Getting ticket types for eventId: [event_id]
DEBUG: Received X ticket types for event [event_id]
DEBUG: Creating ticket type - EventId: [event_id], Name: [name], Price: [price], Quantity: [quantity]
DEBUG: Ticket type created successfully with ID: [doc_id]
```

### **If Ticket Creation Fails:**
1. Check Firebase Authentication (user must be logged in)
2. Check Firestore rules are deployed
3. Check internet connection
4. Look for error messages in console

### **If Tickets Don't Appear:**
1. Check the event ID is correct
2. Verify tickets are created in Firestore console
3. Check the stream is receiving data (debug messages)

## 🔒 **Firestore Rules Setup**

Make sure you have deployed the security rules:

```bash
# Copy the rules
cp firestore_ticket_rules.rules firestore.rules

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 📱 **User Interface Flow**

### **User Dashboard Navigation:**
```
App → User Dashboard → Tickets Tab → Events & Tickets Screen
                                  ↓
                              Click "View Tickets" on Event
                                  ↓
                              User Tickets Screen
                                  ↓
                          Buy Tickets / View My Tickets
```

### **Organizer Dashboard Navigation:**
```
App → Organizer Dashboard → Select Event → Tickets Tab
                                         ↓
                                 Organizer Tickets Screen
                                         ↓
                              Create/Manage/Validate Tickets
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **✅ Working Features:**
- User can see events in "Events & Tickets" screen
- "View Tickets" button appears on each event
- Debug screen allows ticket creation
- Organizer can see tickets tab in event management
- Console shows debug messages

### **🔧 Still Testing:**
- Ticket purchase flow
- QR code generation
- Ticket validation
- Real-time updates

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "View Tickets" button not working**
- **Solution**: Check if `UserTicketsScreen` import is correct
- **Check**: `lib/screens/user_tickets_screen.dart` exists

### **Issue: Debug screen not accessible**
- **Solution**: Look for bug icon (🐛) in app bar
- **Alternative**: Navigate directly to `DebugTicketScreen`

### **Issue: Ticket creation shows success but tickets don't appear**
- **Solution**: Check Firestore console for `ticketTypes` collection
- **Check**: Event ID is correct and matches

### **Issue: Permission denied errors**
- **Solution**: Deploy Firestore security rules
- **Check**: User authentication is working

## 📊 **Database Verification**

### **Check Firestore Console:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Look for collections:
   - `events` (should have your events)
   - `ticketTypes` (should appear after creation)
   - `tickets` (will appear after purchases)

### **Verify Data Structure:**
```
ticketTypes/
  └── [auto-generated-id]/
      ├── eventId: "your-event-id"
      ├── name: "General Admission"
      ├── price: 25.0
      ├── totalQuantity: 100
      ├── soldQuantity: 0
      ├── isActive: true
      └── createdAt: [timestamp]
```

This guide should help you test and verify that the ticket system is working correctly!
